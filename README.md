Database - Alpaca worm egg count

The program will let you enter the results of a faecal test, 
this can be the Mc Masters or modified Stoll test. You then 
enter the results and number and type of egg found. The database 
will record these results over a date period. It will highlight 
the animals in order of egg numbers and create animal reports or 
heard reports.
